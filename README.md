## Introduction

**Bongo Copy Cat** wants to be involved in everything you do but instead just imitates you hitting your keyboard all day. After all it's just a cat.
Supported platforms: **MacOS** and **Windows**.

This is a practice project for me to learn [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [**Tauri**](https://tauri.app/).

## Other Libraries/Dependencies
* [**Rdev**](https://github.com/Narsil/rdev) for listening to global input events on Mac OS.
* [**InputBot**](https://github.com/obv-mikhail/InputBot) for listening to global input events on Windows.

## Installation
* Download exectuables for **MacOS** and **Windows** from the [releases](https://github.com/abjt14/bongo-copy-cat/releases) page.
* Build it yourself.

## Building
You can always build the project youself. This will prevent the system from throwing warnings while installing an unsigned application.

* Download the source code from the [releases](https://github.com/abjt14/bongo-copy-cat/releases) page as a zip file or clone the project using `git clone`.
* Install the [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain.
* You can run, develop, and build the **Tauri** project using **npm**, **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **cargo**.

Don't just fork the project, give the cat a star ⭐️
